# jax-shenanigans

This is my personal repo to learn and fiddle around with JAX. 

I'll be building stuff from scratch (bottom-top approach, which I think it's the best one to learn once you are experienced versus top-bottom approaches), trying to figure out how JAX works, its particularities and also revisit and/or learn new DL techniques along the way, everything under a properly software-engineered package. The structure is as follows:

- `notebooks`: here you'll find my exercises to learn JAX
- `notes`: some useful links, findings, resources, etc.
- `src`: source code for the `jax-shenanigans` library


This is a pip installable library so just run `pip install git+{REPO_URL}` and you'll be good to go if you wanna check it out. It'll be coming to PyPI soon. To manage the package, I'm using [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/)
